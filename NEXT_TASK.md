# Next task

The single task the next session should pick up. Kept in sync with [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).
Start from [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md).

## Status: BLOCKED — a Founder decision is required to continue

*Last verified this way: 2026-07-04, HEAD `d3bd715` — `nia verify` green, 77 tests / 17 files,
analyze clean, no drift, tree clean. State docs reconciled to this baseline the same session.*

**R1 (the craftsmanship backlog) is complete.** The board freeze is lifted. The member app is
clean and healthy: `nia verify` green, `flutter analyze` clean, **77 tests**, no dead code, no
TODOs, CI present, goldens deterministic, docs reconciled. **No unlocked in-authority engineering
work remains.** Every next step needs you:

| Next task | Gate |
|---|---|
| **R3 — Wage Flow (backend)** | Un-pause the backend **and** rule OD-1 (`DECISIONS.md`). Say: *"un-pause backend, OD-1 is X."* |
| **R2 — native install (Android first)** | Your go-ahead + accounts/device. Say: *"build the Android install."* |
| **Q3 — retire legacy surfaces** | An in-authority cleanup once you approve the product call (retire `wallet`/`home`?). Say: *"retire the legacy wallet/home screens."* |
| R4–R8 (backend) | OD-2…OD-6 rulings + backend un-paused. |

Open Founder questions are in [`FOUNDER_REVIEW.md`](FOUNDER_REVIEW.md) (Q2, Q3, Q5, Q7). The OD
rulings expire **2026-07-13**.

## When picked up

Follow the loop in [`docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md`](docs/AUTONOMOUS-LOOP.md): recover state → contract
→ implement → verify (`nia verify` green) → review → update state docs → single-purpose commit →
continue. Respect the Product Bible ([`docs/03_PRODUCT_BIBLE.md`](docs/03_PRODUCT_BIBLE.md)), the
ADRs, and the progress-not-engagement law. Do not invent features or redesign product behaviour.
